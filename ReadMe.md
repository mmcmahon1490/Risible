d. Post stories of their own, that other users will be able to interact with.

8. **SWOT Analysis:** 

Strengths: I think I get the theory of this pretty well
Weaknesses: Sometimes I struggle applying the theory
Opportunities: I now have nearly eight days to practice writing in react while fine tuning my project. There has never been a better time to feel like I'm *just about* there. 
Threats: I have to manage my time better than I did last time. 

Overcoming my weaknesses - I will accomplish this by attacking them head on, and meeting with other class members and staff as many times as possible. Reading as much code as I can, talking it out often, and just experimenting by moving things around. I've made more progress the last three days thatn I probably made the entire rest of camp. I still don't feel like I'm where I want to be, but I can tell I'm close. 

Overcoming my threats - I need to manage my time by getting a fast start this weekend. Put in as much work as possible as early as possible, so that the final few days can be fine tuning instead of "oh my heck I need to write *something*.

# Title: Risible


## Description: Risible will be a news compiler, but not serious news - this is for stories that would belong on The Onion, if they were fake. We LOVE Florida Man. On this app, users will be able to 

- Read posted stories.
- Comment on those stories.
- Vote the stories up or down depending on how much they like them.
- Post stories of their own, that other users will be able to interact with. 



*** Edit the wireframes, make wireframes and component hierarchy visible to the public (or post as an image) ***

### Wireframes: https://app.diagrams.net/#LRisible

### Component Heirarchy: https://app.diagrams.net/#LComponent-Tree

### API: Airtable will store data such as the article link, an article description, author, published date, and posted date. 

## MVP: 

- Home page that displays articles, and their point score
- Links to sub-pages where users can comment on the story
- Render Airtable data to the page and store it. 
- Render user created articles


## Post-MVP: I'd like to try incorporating:

- A search feature
- Sorting options to display articles by their score, the post date, or search by keywords
- Day/night viewing modes
- Allow user comments
- Allow posts to be voted up or down

## SWOT Analysis: 

- Strengths: I think I get the theory of this pretty well
- Weaknesses: Sometimes I struggle applying the theory
- Opportunities: I now have nearly eight days to practice writing in react while fine tuning my project. There has never been a better time to feel like I'm *just about* there. 
- Threats: I have to manage my time better than I did last time. 

**Overcoming my weaknesses** - I will accomplish this by attacking them head on, and meeting with other class members and staff as many times as possible. Reading as much code as I can, talking it out often, and just experimenting by moving things around. I've made more progress the last three days thatn I probably made the entire rest of camp. I still don't feel like I'm where I want to be, but I can tell I'm close. 

**Overcoming my threats** - I need to manage my time by getting a fast start this weekend. Put in as much work as possible as early as possible, so that the final few days can be fine tuning instead of "oh my heck I need to write *something*.
